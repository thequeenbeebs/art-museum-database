# DELIVERABLES

It is time to work on our project. This is a great chance to exercise everything we covered to get CRUD in Rails down for our code challenge!
The rest of the day is to be focused on this project.

Note: THIS is NOT the end of phase project.

mini solo project deliverables:

Due Date: Monday the 14th at 1pmCST 2pmET

Core Deliverables:

Students must build an app in Rails which :
    * expresses a Many-Many relationship
    * has entire CRUD functionality for at least ONE model
    * has all views and controller actions for the ONE model
    * has index templates for at least 2 models(views)

Advanced Deliverables

    * interactivity ( we dont want to type in our URL, we want to click on the page for a better user experience)
    * validations( we dont want our user to create empty strings, nor repetitive data :eyes: )
